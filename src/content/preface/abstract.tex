A new approach for solving the Schr\"odinger equation based on
genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (NN) is
presented. Feed-forward perceptron-type network is used to
represent the avefunction, while network parameters are 
optimized by micro-genetic algorithm so that the NN
satisfies the Schr\"odinger equation.
In the GA breeding process, random point evaluation method
(RPEM) for fitness evaluation is introduced to improve the
convergence. Final solution is obtained by invoking
deterministic optimizer which corresponds to a <<learning
process>> of the NN. The present method is tested in the
calculation of one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and
other model potentials.
